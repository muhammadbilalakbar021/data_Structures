There are three resaons why I prefer jogging to other sports
One reason is that jogging is a cheap sropt  I can practice
it anywhere at any time with no need for a ball or any other
equipment. Another reason why I prefer jogging is that it
is friendly to my heart. I don't have to exhaust myself or
do excessive eforts while yyyyyyyyyyyyy. finally , I prefer this
sport because it is safe. It isn't as risky as other sports
like gymnastics, racing or horseback riding. For all these reasons,
I consider joging the best sport of all. Yhe taable is put in the rum.
